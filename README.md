### Apache vhosts configuration

After installation the Apache vhosts configuration is found at `/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/`. Change it and restart Apache using `sudo apachectl -k restart`.

### PHP ini

The PHP ini file is installed as a symlink in each PHP version, pointing to `/usr/local/php/php.ini`. One file for all PHP versions. ü•≥

## Installed software

The following software is included in a full installation.

- **xcode-select** Xcode command line developer tools. You probably already have this ‚Äì¬†feel free to pas `--no-xcode-select`.
- **Homebrew**
- **Openldap**
- **Libiconv**
- **MySQL**
- **Dnsmasq** to be able to browser `http://{any}.test`
