# macos-web-development

Installs MacOS web development AMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP).


## Why macos-web-development?

Because you want to

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --no-dry-run
```

... and then instantly create a cool PHP based website at http://cool.test

```bash
mkdir -p ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public && echo "<h1>Cool</h1>" >> ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public/index.php
```

... without reading tutorials and performing installation steps manually. ü§©

### Also

Because you want to manage your own stack of independent software, which you are free to mess around with in any way you want. *Macos-web-development* simply installs packages ‚Äì mostly with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (which is also automatically installed) ‚Äì and edits configuration files.



## Features

- Browse `http://{any}.test` to visit `~/{user}/WebServer/sites/{any}/public` (fully customizable path).
- Switch between PHP versions 5.6 to 7.4 using command `sphp {version}`, for example `sphp 7.2`.
- Distributes Apache vhosts configuraton and PHP ini from example files in repository. Simply adjust them to your needs before installation... or not. üôÉ
- Install desired software only, by opting out.
- Defaults to dry run ‚Äì see what the script will do before actually doing it.
- Uninstall. Not sure when you would use this, but hey, it's a free world. üòÄ

### Apache configuration

After installation the Apache vhosts configuration is found at `/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/`. Change it whenever you want and restart Apache using `sudo apachectl -k restart`.


### PHP ini

The custom PHP ini file is installed as a symlink in each PHP version, pointing to `/usr/local/php/php.ini`. One file for all PHP versions. Enjoy! ü•≥


## Usage

#### Full installation (dry run with info)

```

Then browse http://localhost, or http://cool.test after creating it:

mkdir -p ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public && echo "<h1>Cool</h1>" >> ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public/index.html
```


#### Installation with selected versions of PHP and no MySQL

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --no-php-5-6 --no-php-7-0 --no-php-7-4 --no-mysql --no-dry-run
```


#### Uninstallation

Maybe you're poking around with your computer and want to *uninstall... install... uninstall... install...* üòé

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --uninstall --no-dry-run
```


#### See the help for all details

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --help
```


## Installed software

The following software is included in a full installation.

- **xcode-select** Xcode command line developer tools. You probably already have this... feel free to pass `--no-xcode-select`.
- **Homebrew**
- **Openldap**
- **Libiconv**
- **MySQL**
- **Dnsmasq** to be able to browser `http://{any}.test`
- **Apache** some say it's better with Homebrew than the MacOS default. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Script based PHP configuration and PHP switching with `sphp` only works with a Homebrew:ed Apache.
- **PHP** versions 5.6 to¬†7.4
- **sphp** a PHP switching script
