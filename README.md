# macos-web-development

Installs MacOS web development AMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP).


## Why macos-web-development?

### Because you want to

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --no-dry-run
```

... and then instantly create a cool PHP based website at http://cool.test

```bash
mkdir -p ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public && echo "<h1>Cool</h1>" >> ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public/index.php
```

... without reading tutorials and performing installation steps manually. 🤩

You will also be able to create http://cool.com.test or http://cool.co.uk.test or whatever.

### Also

Because you want to manage your own stack of independent software, which you are free to mess around with in any way you want. *Macos-web-development* simply installs packages – mostly with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (which is also automatically installed) – and edits configuration files.



## Features

- **Browse** `http://{any}.test` to visit `~/{user}/WebServer/sites/{any}/public` (fully customizable path).
- **Switch** between PHP versions 5.6 to 7.4 using command `sphp {version}`, for example `sphp 7.2`.
- **Distribute** Apache vhosts configuraton and PHP ini from template files in repository. Simply adjust them to your needs before installation... or not. 🙃
- **Opt put** of software you don't want. For example `--no-mysql`.
- **Dry run** – check which software is already installed etc. This is the default behaviour, use `--no-dry-run` to actually install stuff.
- **Uninstall** – not sure when you would use this, but hey, it's a free world. 😀

### Apache configuration

After installation the Apache vhosts configuration is found at `/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`. Change it whenever you want and restart Apache using `sudo apachectl -k restart`.


### PHP ini

The custom PHP ini file is installed as a symlink in each PHP version, pointing to `/usr/local/php/php.ini`. One file for all PHP versions = enjoy. 🥳


## Usage

```


#### Installation with preset

##### Common

Installs mandatory stuff and **Apache**, **MySQL**, **PHP 7.1**, **7.2**, **7.3** and **Dnsmasq**.

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --p-common --no-dry-run
```

##### Minimal

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --uninstall --no-dry-run
```


#### See the help for all details

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --help
```


## Installed software

The following software is included in a full installation.

- **xcode-select** Xcode command line developer tools. You probably already have this... feel free to pass `--no-xcode-select`.
- **Homebrew**
- **Openldap**
- **Libiconv**
- **MySQL**
- **Dnsmasq** to be able to browse `http://{any}.test`
- **Apache** some say it's better with Homebrew than the MacOS default. 🤷‍♂️ Script based Apache PHP configuration (and PHP switching with `sphp`) only works with a Homebrew:ed Apache.
- **PHP** versions 5.6 to 7.4
- **sphp** a PHP switching script

All of the above will only be installed if not already on the machine. However, **Apache** and versions of **PHP** will only be skipped by default if they were already installed *with Homebrew*. If not, they will be installed with Homebrew and replace existing ones, which will remain untouched on the system. Should you choose to uninstall with *Macos-web-development*, the existing software should "come alive" like nothing ever happened.


### Uninstallation

- Will not uninstall **xcode-select**, **Homebrew** and **Openldap**.
- Will not remove the server root folder at `~/WebServer/sites` (or your custom folder), or any websites in there.
- Will uninstall the **MySQL server**, but will not remove any **databases**.
- Takes no other options than `--no-dry-run` and will always uninstall all supported versions of **PHP** etc.


### Complementary installation

Should you decide that you need PHP 7.4 after installation without it, just execute a new installation. Installed software will be left alone, and only the missing packages will be installed. This should also work with future releases of PHP, once they're implemented in this script.

## Requirements

### MacOS

Successfully tested with a fresh installation of **MacOS Catalina** *(10.15.3)*

Probably works with earlier versions too... 🙄
