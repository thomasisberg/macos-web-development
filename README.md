# macos-web-development

Installs macOS web development AMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP).


## Why macos-web-development?

### Because you want to

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --no-dry-run
```

... and then instantly create a cool PHP based website at http://cool.test

```bash
mkdir -p ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public && echo "<h1>Cool</h1>" >> ~/WebServer/sites/cool/public/index.php
```

... without reading tutorials and performing installation steps manually. ü§©

You will also be able to create http://cool.com.test or http://cool.co.uk.test or whatever.

### Also

Because you want to manage your own stack of independent software, which you are free to mess around with in any way you want. Macos-web-development simply installs packages, mostly with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (which is also automatically installed), and edits configuration files.



## Features

- **Browse** `http://{any}.test` to visit `~/{user}/WebServer/sites/{any}/public` (fully customizable path).
- **Switch** between PHP versions 5.6 to 8.1 using command `sphp {version}`, for example `sphp 8.1`.
- **Distribute** Apache vhosts configuraton and PHP ini from template files in repository. Simply adjust them to your needs before installation... or not. üôÉ
- **Opt out** of software you don't want. For example `--no-mysql`.
- **Dry run** ‚Äì check which software is already installed etc. This is the default behaviour, use `--no-dry-run` to actually install stuff.
- **Uninstall** ‚Äì removes most stuff, but not all. ‚òùÔ∏è [See details below](#uninstallation-1).

### Apache configuration

After installation the Apache vhosts configuration is found at `/usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf` for Intel based macs and at `/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf` for newer macs. Change it whenever you want and restart Apache using `brew services restart httpd`.


### PHP ini

The custom PHP ini file is installed as a symlink in each PHP version, pointing to `/usr/local/php/php.ini`. One file for all PHP versions = enjoy. ü•≥


## Installing macos-web-development (self installation)

**macos-web-development** was originally not intended to be installed, and works fine by just executing `./macos-web-delopment.sh` from your downloaded repository. [See Usage below](#usage).

If you self install macos-web-development you can execute it from anywhere by replacing `./macos-web-delopment.sh` with `macos-web-delopment` in the Usage instructions below. This is primarily useful for future [complementary installations](#complementary-installation).


#### How to self install

```bash
./self-install
```

* Installs files to `/usr/local/macos-web-development/`.
* Creates executable symlink at `/usr/local/bin/macos-web-development` (should be in your `$PATH`).


#### Caveats

When you self install macos-web-development, the templates for Apache and PHP configurations are also installed, so you need to tweak them (if desired) before self installation.

You can always perform a new self installation to update macos-web-development (and your templates).


## Usage

Replace `./macos-web-delopment.sh` with `macos-web-delopment` in all exmples below if you have self installed macos-web-development.

#### Full installation (dry run with info)

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh
```


#### Full installation

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --no-dry-run
```


#### Installation with selected version of PHP and no MySQL

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --only-php-7-4 --no-mysql --no-dry-run
```


#### Installation with preset

##### Common

Installs mandatory stuff and **Apache**, **MySQL**, **PHP 7.4** and **Dnsmasq**.

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --p-common --no-dry-run
```

##### Minimal

Installs mandatory stuff and **Apache**, **PHP 7.4** and **Dnsmasq**. No **MySQL**.

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --p-minimal --no-dry-run
```


#### Uninstallation

Maybe you're poking around with your computer and want to *uninstall... install... uninstall... install...* üòé

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --uninstall --no-dry-run
```


#### See the help for all details

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --help
```


## Installed software

The following software is included in a full installation.

- **xcode-select** Xcode command line developer tools. You probably already have this... feel free to pass `--no-xcode-select`.
- **Homebrew**
- **Openldap**
- **Libiconv**
- **MySQL**
- **Dnsmasq** to be able to browse `http://{any}.test`
- **Apache** some say it's better with Homebrew than the MacOS default. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Script based Apache PHP configuration (and PHP switching with `sphp`) only works with a Homebrew:ed Apache.
- **PHP** versions 5.6 to 8.1
- **sphp** a PHP switching script

All of the above will only be installed if not already on the machine. However, **Apache** and versions of **PHP** will only be skipped by default if they were already installed with **Homebrew**. If not, they will be installed with Homebrew and replace existing ones, which will remain untouched on the system. Should you choose to uninstall with macos-web-development, the existing software should be brought back to life, as if nothing ever happened.


### Uninstallation

- Will not uninstall **xcode-select**, **Homebrew** and **Openldap**.
- Will not remove the server root folder at `~/WebServer/sites` (or the folder you specified), or any websites in there.
- Will uninstall the **MySQL server**, but will not remove any **databases**.
- Takes no other options than `--no-dry-run` and will always uninstall all supported versions of **PHP** etc.


### Complementary installation

Should you decide that you need a specific feature after installation without it, just execute a new installation. Installed software will be left alone, and only the missing packages will be installed.

#### To only install a new version of PHP (8.1 in this example)

```bash
./macos-web-development.sh --only-php --only-php-8-1 --no-dry-run
```
